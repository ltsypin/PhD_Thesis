# PhD Thesis data and code

This repository contains the data and analyses I in my dissertation as 
submitted to the Caltech library after my defense. It is in the form of a 
bunch of Jupyter note books, corresponding to figures in the diss, 
sometimes comobining multiple figures into one notebook when they come
from the same dataset analysis. I hope it is clear enough to be useful. 
I'm happy to answer any questions.
