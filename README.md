# PhD Thesis data and code

This repository contains the data and analyses I in my dissertation as submitted to the Caltech library
after my defense. It is in the form of one giant jupyter notebook because I ran out of time, but I hope
it is clear enough to be useful. I'm happy to answer any questions.
